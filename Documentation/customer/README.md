# Customer

The customer module depicts all information related to the company's clients. When the module opens, a selection screen is presented to the user. This screen presents a listing of customers information and allows access to further customer details as the user clicks on the customer's name.

- [Main](/Documentation/customer/tabs/main.markdown)
- [Invoice Dashboard](/Documentation/customer/tabs/invoiceDashboard.markdown)
- [Invoice Explorer](/Documentation/customer/tabs/invoiceExplorer.markdown)
